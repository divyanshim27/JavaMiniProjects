# Java Mini Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of **Java mini projects** that I created while learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
Each project demonstrates **real-world system simulations** such as banking transactions, movie ticket booking, and more to come.  

The aim of this repo is to **practice core Java concepts** like:
- Classes & Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Packages  
- Exception Handling
